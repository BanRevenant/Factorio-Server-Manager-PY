# Factorio Server Manager-PY

This initially started as a comprehensive rewrite of the original Factorio Server Manager (previously written in Go), I have now taken the project in a slightly different direction. This new project is now built entirely in Python. This repository is the front end for an in development project called D-Wire found here https://github.com/BanRevenant/D-Wire

This portion of the project will gradually pickup in traction as D-Wire gets closer to completion.

## Preview

Here are a few screenshots of the front end, which is nearing completion. This project is still in progressâ€”expect plenty of coffee and late nights ahead!
